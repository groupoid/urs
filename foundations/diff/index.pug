                    The $\mathbf{Diff}$ type represents the exterior derivative, a fundamental operation
                    in differential geometry that maps a differential $n$-form to an $(n+1)$-form on a
                    smooth set. It is essential for modeling differential cohomology and physical systems
                    involving fields, such as electromagnetism.
                +tex.
                    $\mathbf{Diff}$ interacts with the $\mathbf{Forms}$ type, operating within the cohesive
                    type system’s smooth sets ($\mathbf{SmthSet}$), and ensures properties like the nilpotency
                    of the derivative, critical for exactness and cohomology.

                h2 Formation
                +tex.
                    $\mathbf{Definition\ 3.5.1}$ ($\mathbf{Diff}$-Formation). The exterior derivative type
                    $\mathbf{Diff}$ is formed for a differential $n$-form $\omega : \Omega^n(X)$ on a
                    smooth set $X : \mathbf{SmthSet}$, yielding an $(n+1)$-form
                    $\mathbf{d}\ \omega : \Omega^{n+1}(X)$.
                +tex(true).
                    $$
                        \mathbf{Diff} :
                    $$
                    $$
                        \prod_{n : \mathbb{N}} \prod_{X : \mathbf{SmthSet}}
                        \prod_{\omega : \Omega^n(X)} \Omega^{n+1}(X).
                    $$

                h2 Introduction
                +tex.
                    $\mathbf{Definition\ 3.5.2}$ ($\mathbf{Diff}$-Introduction). A term of type
                    $\Omega^{n+1}(X)$ is introduced by applying the exterior derivative $\mathbf{d}$ to
                    a differential $n$-form $\omega : \Omega^n(X)$, producing $\mathbf{d}\ \omega$.
                +tex(true).
                    $$
                        \mathbf{d} :
                    $$
                    $$
                        \prod_{n : \mathbb{N}} \prod_{X : \mathbf{SmthSet}}
                        \prod_{\omega : \Omega^n(X)} \Omega^{n+1}(X).
                    $$
                +code.
                    let diff_intro (n : int) (omega : exp) : exp =
                        Diff (n, omega)

                +tex.
                    $\mathbf{Definition\ 3.5.3}$ ($\mathbf{Diff}$-Elimination). The eliminator for
                    $\mathbf{Diff}$ enables reasoning about $(n+1)$-forms by relating them to their
                    preimages under the exterior derivative, supporting properties like exactness or
                    applications of Stokes’ theorem.
                +tex(true).
                    $$
                        \mathbf{DiffInd} :
                    $$
                    $$
                        \prod_{n : \mathbb{N}} \prod_{X : \mathbf{SmthSet}}
                        \prod_{\beta : \Omega^{n+1}(X) \to U}
                        \left( \prod_{\omega : \Omega^n(X)} \beta\ (\mathbf{d}\ \omega) \right) \to
                        \prod_{\eta : \Omega^{n+1}(X)} \beta\ \eta.

                +tex.
                    $\mathbf{Definition\ 3.5.4}$ ($\mathbf{Diff}$-Computation). The exterior derivative
                    is nilpotent, satisfying $\mathbf{d} \circ \mathbf{d} = 0$, so applying $\mathbf{d}$
                    to $\mathbf{d}\ \omega$ yields the zero $(n+2)$-form.
                +tex(true).
                    $$
                        \mathbf{d}\ (\mathbf{d}\ \omega) =_{\Omega^{n+2}(X)} 0.
                    $$
                +code.

                      | Diff (n, Diff (m, omega)) -> Forms (n + 2, Var "X") (* Simplified to zero form *)
                      | _ -> ...

                h2 Theorems
                +tex.
                    $\mathbf{Theorem\ 3.5.5}$ (Stokes’ Theorem). For a differential $n$-form
                    $\omega : \Omega^n(X)$ on a smooth set $X$ with boundary $\partial X$, the exterior
                    derivative satisfies Stokes’ theorem, relating the integral of $\omega$ over the
                    boundary to the integral of $\mathbf{d}\ \omega$ over $X$.
                +tex(true).
                    $$
                        \int_{\partial X} \omega = \int_X \mathbf{d}\ \omega.
                    $$
                +code.
                    let stokes_theorem (n : int) (x : exp) (omega : exp) : exp =
